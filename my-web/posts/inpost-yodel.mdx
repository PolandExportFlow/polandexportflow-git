## What’s the Deal?

On April 17, 2025, InPost acquired **95.5%** of Judge Logistics Ltd, Yodel’s parent company, through a debt-to-equity conversion valued at **£106**m (or **£136**m including debt refinancing), with PayPoint retaining a **4.5%** stake ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/polands-inpost-acquires-uk-parcel-firm-yodel-2025-04-17/)). This follows a partnership launched in October 2024, where Yodel supported InPost’s “locker-to-door” delivery model ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/17/polish-parcel-locker-network-inpost-buys-uk-delivery-firm-yodel)). The acquisition boosts InPost’s UK parcel capacity to over **300 million annually**, securing an **8% market share** ([Retail Gazette](https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2025/04/inpost-acquires-yodel/)).

**Why it matters for you:** This blockbuster deal **reduces shipping costs by up to 25%** and delivers Polish goods like furniture or car parts to the UK in as little as 3 days, opening doors to the £90bn UK e-commerce market for your business ([Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/emo/ecommerce/united-kingdom)).

## InPost and Yodel: A Perfect Match for Parcel Forwarding

InPost’s network of **10,000 parcel lockers** and **18,000 pick-up points** across the UK pairs seamlessly with Yodel’s expertise in home delivery, handling 190 million parcels yearly ([Business Live](https://www.business-live.co.uk/enterprise/inpost-acquires-rival-yodel-become-31447025)). Together, they offer a flexible logistics solution—locker pick-ups for convenience and doorstep delivery for larger items—ideal for businesses importing from Poland.
