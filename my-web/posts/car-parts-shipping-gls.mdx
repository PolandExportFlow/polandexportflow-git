Car parts are not as easy to pack as clothes, but shipping them by courier is entirely possible with the right approach. GLS specializes in standard parcel shipments and does not handle palletized goods like engines or transmissions.

To ensure your shipment is accepted, check GLS regulations for restricted items. Shipments must also meet specific size limits:

- **Domestic:** Max weight 31.5 kg
- **International:** Max weight 40 kg
- **Dimensions:** Width 80 cm, Height 60 cm, Length 200 cm
- **Size Limit:** The sum of the circumference and longest side cannot exceed 300 cm

## How to Pack Car Parts for Safe Shipping?

Proper packaging is crucial to ensure that car parts arrive undamaged. Here’s how to do it right:

- **Thoroughly clean the parts** – remove any oils, grease, or fluids.
- **Use sturdy packaging** – opt for strong cardboard boxes with eco-friendly fillers like skropak, flopak, wood wool, or honeycomb paper.
- **Secure the inside of the package** – fill empty spaces to prevent parts from shifting.
- **Extra protection for larger parts** – reinforced boxes and dedicated fillers will help prevent damage.
- **Avoid liquid contamination** – ensure that all parts are free from fuel, oil, or other residues to prevent leaks.
