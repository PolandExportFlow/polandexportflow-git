## 1. Market Analysis and Identifying Your Needs

**Define Your Requirements** - Think about what products you want to sell. Are you looking for bulk orders or smaller batches? The choice of supplier should be based on your specific needs and sales model.
--
**Study Your Competitors** - Check how your competitors operate. What products do they offer, what are their prices, and what kind of reviews do they receive? This will help you establish the criteria your potential supplier should meet.

## 3. Verifying Potential Partners

**Reviews and References** - Check reviews on platforms such as Sky-Shop, AtomStore, or Droplo, and use information shared in Facebook groups.
--
**Certificates and Standards** - Make sure the supplier has the required certifications (e.g., ISO) and meets EU standards – this ensures high-quality products.

## 4. Negotiating and Finalizing the Partnership

**Request for Quotation** (RFQ) - Start by preparing a detailed RFQ that includes product specifications, delivery deadlines, and preferred payment terms. This will help establish clear communication with the supplier.
--
**Negotiate Terms** - Once you have the RFQ, negotiate the terms of cooperation, including minimum order quantities, payment conditions (e.g., trade credit), and return policies. Leverage the experience of others to secure the best possible deal. Focus on transparency and honesty to ensure a strong, long-term partnership.

## 5. Testing the Collaboration

**Order Samples** - Before placing a large order, ask for samples to evaluate product quality and delivery punctuality.
--
**Analyze the Results** - Compare the received products with your expectations and decide whether to continue working with that supplier.
